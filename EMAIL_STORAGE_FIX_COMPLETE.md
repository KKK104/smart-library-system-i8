# ✅ EMAIL STORAGE ISSUE - FIXED!

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Users were stored in `library_members` table but you were looking in Supabase **Authentication** dashboard → Users weren't visible where you expected them.

**After**: Users are now stored in **Supabase Authentication** system → They appear exactly where you're looking!

## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### ✅ Updated Frontend Forms
- **`app/page.tsx`** - Updated signup form to use `/api/user/signup-simple`
- **`app/page.tsx`** - Updated login form to use `/api/user/login-simple`

### ✅ Created New APIs
- **`app/api/user/signup-simple/route.ts`** - Uses Supabase Auth for user creation
- **`app/api/user/login-simple/route.ts`** - Uses Supabase Auth for user login

### ✅ Test Results
